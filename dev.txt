### OLD NOTES review

Algebra = Operations + Types

e.g.
* create is an operation
* A and String is a type
* Db is a piece of Algebra that can be composed or extended

trait Db[F[_]] {
  def create[A]: F[String]
  def delete(id: String): F[Boolean]
}

Interpreter = "Implementation" of an Algebra

i.e. Materialization for specific type

---
they are alternatives:

(tagless) final encoding: typeclass
* ignore tagless
* final encoding: means that you can describe operations with functions

initial encoding: free monad
* you can describe operations with case classes

trait Db {
  case class Create[F[_], A](a: A)
  case class Delete[F[_]](id: String)
}

Tagless Final Encoding == MTL-style program composition
mtl is now is a final tagless encoding of common effects
The `mtl` (Monad Transformer library) library in haskell used to provide the concrete monad transformers types, which are now in `transformers`
Option, Either, IO are all effect/context/wrapper
